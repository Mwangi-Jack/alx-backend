# 0x01. Caching

## Cache
- A cache is a hardware or software componenct that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

- Caching therefore is a technique used to store copies for frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location i.e. cache to improve the performance and efficiency of data retrieval.

## Cache Replacement Policies
- Also known as Cache replacement algorithms or cache algorithms
- They are optimizing instructions/algorithms which a computer program or hardware-maintained structure can utilize to manage a cache of information
- When the cache is full, the algorithm chooses which items to discard to make room for new data

N/B:
  - A Cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in cache while a cache miss occurs when the data cannot be found in cache
